# Fantasy-Sports-Dashboard

If you are familiar at all with Fantasy Sports, well this will make perfect sense. If not, you can still try and follow along. 

This project is a fantasy dashboard for the competitive League of Legends scene.

It is fully automated site coded in Google Sheets (similar to Excel) that utilizes various vlookups, queries, macros, and automatic formatting updates.

The dashboard displays the rosters, scoreboard, standings, stats, and past weeks' scores.
